In this module, I learned how use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake was visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake has a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

What I Learned:
- Created a branch from the main branch on GitHub.
- Added, commited, and pushed data to a GitHub branch.
- Merged a branch with the main branch on GitHub.
- Retrieved data from a GeoJSON file.
- Made API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
- Populated geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
- Added multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
- Used JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps. 
- Rendered maps on a local server.
